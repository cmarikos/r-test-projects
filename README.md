# R Test Projects

This repository is a collection of R projects and lab assignments completed during a university course. It also includes some of my own explorations beyond classwork (notably experiments with **igraph** and a **Shiny app**).

## Contents

- **Labs & Projects**  
  A series of structured exercises covering R programming fundamentals, data wrangling, and applied analysis.

- **Explorations**  
  - **igraph experiments**: Graph/network analysis practice, building and visualizing network structures.  
  - **Shiny app**: Playing with an interactive web application built with R Shiny to explore dynamic visualizations and user-driven analysis for igraph visuals

## Getting Started
